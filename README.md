## üå≠ How It's Made: 

**Tech used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, <a href="https://statsapi.mlb.com/" target="_blank">MLB Stats API</a>

This site uses the current date to access and format data from the Major League Baseball (MLB) statistics API, in order to provide users with a display of real-time information.


## üß¢ Optimization: 

Win / Loss / Save information was unavailable in the APIs used in this project. If time permitted, I would find this data. <br />
Refactor the UI for a cleaner look.


## ‚òÄÔ∏è Lessons Learned: 
Implementing asynchronous programming by practicing features such as `async/await` and `Promise.all()` to handle multiple API requests. <br />
Utilizing DOM manipulation to modify HTML elements using JavaScript to display data to the user. <br />
Formatting the JavaScript `Date` object to both display to the user and properly access the API data.
